## Dev notes

I developed this tool for myself because I wanted an addon manager with a nice, modern GTK+Adwaita UI. And also because I wanted to develop a desktop GUI app for a long time üòä.

**Trigger warning:** This is my first time using Python and as a result the source code could be horribly non-pythonic. 

## Features

- Update your git-versioned addons! üîÑ
- Easily switch between different addon branches üå±

### What's coming (in no specific order)

- Link addons that are not git-versioned to a git repository üîó
- Addons backup üíæ
- Support for multiple WoW instances üóÉÔ∏è
- Addons management (adding, ignoring and removing addons) üñäÔ∏è
- Flatpak distribution üì¶
