## Dev notes

I developed this tool for myself because I wanted an addon manager with a nice, modern GTK+Adwaita UI. And also because I wanted to develop a desktop GUI app for a long time 😊.

**Trigger warning:** This is my first time using Python and as a result the source code could be horribly non-pythonic.

- Easily switch between different addon branches 🌱
- Link addons that are not git-versioned to a git repository 🔗

### What's coming (in no specific order)
